            are summarized in a separate extraction field. Once extraction is complete for an
            assessment, endpoint/adverse outcomes names may be adjusted to use terms that best
            work across studies or assessments using the data clean-up tool (the original name as
            presented in the study will be retained in the "Endpoint Name in Study" field). If the
            endpoint is a repeated measure, then indicate the time in parentheses, e.g., running
            wheel activity (6 wk), using the abbreviated format: seconds = sec, minutes = min,
            hours = h, days = d, weeks = wk, months = mon, years = y.`,
