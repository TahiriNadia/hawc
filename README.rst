The Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC) is a website designed to
capture key data and analyses performed in conducting human-health assessment
of chemicals and other environmental exposures in-order to establish hazard
identification and potentially derive quantitative levels of concern.

For more information, please see the `documentation <http://hawc.readthedocs.org/>`_.



TODO
----

1. make sure that we don't have lots of data pivots that don't have any sorts applied; since we're now enforcing a sort order, there could be lots of broken visuals.
2. add some tests to the openpyxl changes in areas where code has changed.
